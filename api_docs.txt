1️⃣ What is an API?

API = Application Programming Interface

👉 Simple meaning:
An API is a messenger that allows two applications to talk to each other.

Real Life Example 🍽️

You go to a restaurant.

You give order to the waiter.

Waiter gives order to kitchen.

Kitchen prepares food.

Waiter brings food back.

👉 Here:

You = Client

Kitchen = Server

Waiter = API

API takes your request → sends to server → returns response.

2️⃣ Types of APIs (Based on Access)
1️⃣ Open API (Public API)

Available for everyone

Example:

Twitter API

Google Maps API

2️⃣ Internal API (Private API)

Used inside a company

Example:

Company internal HR system API

3️⃣ Partner API

Shared with business partners only

Requires authentication

4️⃣ Composite API

Combines multiple APIs in one request

Example:

One request returns user data + order data + payment data

3️⃣ Types of API Architectures

This is VERY important for FastAPI 🚀

🔹 1. REST API (Most Popular)

REST = Representational State Transfer

Uses HTTP methods:

GET → Fetch data

POST → Create data

PUT → Update data

DELETE → Remove data

Example:

GET /users
POST /users
GET /users/1
DELETE /users/1

👉 FastAPI is mainly used to build REST APIs

🔹 2. SOAP API

XML based

Very strict

Used in banking systems

🔹 3. GraphQL

Client decides what data to fetch

Created by Meta Platforms (Facebook)

🔹 4. WebSocket API

Real-time communication

Example:

Chat apps

Live trading apps
